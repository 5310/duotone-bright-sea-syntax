# DuoTone Bright Sea

A brighter variant of the original [DuoTone Dark Sea](https://atom.io/themes/duotone-dark-sea-syntax) theme for Atom.

Very little of this repository has been altered from the origin: [simurai/duotone-light-syntax](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-light-syntax)

The following are features of the master DuoTone syntax theme.

## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...

More optimizations to come. See the growing list of [all languages](/styles/languages).


## Variations

Here a list for all [DuoTone themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone). Or at least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added. :grin:


### Issues and contributing

If you would like to create a new __Issue__ or __PR__, please do so in:

- __this repo__ if it's about __color__ changes, like in `colors.less` or `syntax-variables.less`.
- __[DuoTone master template](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax)__ if it's about __everything else__, like in improving language support. Changes will trickle down into this theme too.
