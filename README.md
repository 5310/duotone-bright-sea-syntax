# DuoTone light

DuoTone light is a syntax theme for Atom.

It only uses 2 hues, copper & blue and tries to:

1. Highlight only the __important__ parts
2. __Tone down__ less important parts. Like punctuation, brackets etc.

This hopefully leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.

__Note__: For the above reasons it might not work well with all languages.
